# A program that can work out the amount
# of tax to withhold from employee salaries.
#
# Salesure is a social media marketing startup. They have 10 employees working on a casual
# basis. Being a small company, Salesure do not have resources to purchase professional payroll
# software. They have hired you to write a simple Python program that can work out the amount
# of tax to withhold from their employee salaries.
#
# Employees are payed fortnightly, and because of casual nature of the job each fortnight the
# payment is different. The amount of withheld tax depends on the gross payment in each
# fortnight, and the income tax rates for the corresponding income bracket.
#
# An example of withheld tax calculation goes like this. Sam is entitled to fortnightly payment of
# $1870. To calculate income tax applicable, an estimate of Sam's annual income is needed.
# There are 52.143 weeks in a year. An estimation of annual income will therefore be $1870 Ã—
# 52.143 / 2 = $48,753.705 or $48,753 after rounding down. From the table, the applicable tax
# rate is 28%. Hence, the amount of tax to withhold will be 28% of $1870 = $523.60, and Sam will
# be payed an after-tax salary of $1346.40 in this fortnight.
#
# Using this method, your program will ask the user for the employee name and their gross
# fortnightly salary, and then it will work out the tax to withhold and actual salary to be payed
# out. At the end of a calculation, program would ask if user wants tax calculation of another
# employee (in which case it loop through the whole process) or finish.
#
# You do not have to handle invalid inputs (like non-numeric salary, empty name etc.). All the
# currency figures must be displayed as floating point numbers with 2 decimal places.
